# Titanic Survival Prediction#
## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a Titanic passenger survived or not based on their details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.  
It is built in **Python** using popular data science libraries.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
## Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest classification models
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC
- Saving trained model for future use
## Dataset
Dataset is loaded directly from `seaborn`'s built-in Titanic dataset. No manual download required.
##  How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandrikakaicharla/titanic-survival-prediction.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
3. Open the notebook (.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all cells.
